# WhitePaper

**FOREWORD**

In January 1996, Bill Gates published an article entitled "Content is King", which became one of the early Internet classics. In that article he described the characteristics of the Internet that laid the foundation for the creator economy. He wrote: "One of the exciting things about the Internet is that anyone with a personal computer and a modem can publish any content they create."&#x20;

Creation and sharing as a way for humans to gain recognition from each other allows people to connect and trust each other in the process of communication, thus forming an identity. The world of the internet has never been easier to share, with freshly shared content instantly flowing into a torrent of data at the touch of a keyboard and mouse. The internet has brought about a golden age of media - a world of infinite abundance where anyone can create what they want and everyone can find what interests them. But while Gates' prediction about making money from online content proved correct, most of the money bypassed the creators who created the content and went into the pockets of the platforms that aggregated it. The rise of large internet company platforms, platform data traffic restrictions, creative sharing content restrictions and a host of other actions have made sharing, and creator revenue, less simple. From content creators to content sharers, everything they can share is gradually becoming bound by the filtering of centralised platform algorithms. Content creators cannot share what they love, content sharers cannot find what they love, everything is controlled by centralised platforms and people no longer have the right to freely publish and share what they love. Sharing, as a basic way of identifying with something, has become difficult in the centralised world of the internet, where the identity that comes from sharing ultimately becomes the user's identity with the platform, and each user's own rights are not in their own hands.&#x20;

In the Web 2.0 era, we have been poisoned by numerous centralized monopolistic technologies.Privacy, entitlement, and even the ownership of our data are being constantly being stripped away under the encroachment of centralized technologies. We are all content creators on the Internet, and unknowingly, we have become data laborers who are constantly exploited by the big platforms.&#x20;

A success of a book, only possible with the talent of a writer, is only made possible by publishers and distributors. The magic of a live performance, wrapped in the fate of decisions of agencies and venues. This demonstrates how the sharing of knowledge and culture has become unnecessarily separated by multiple entities. Middlemen are sandwiched between the two parties to earn profits，the process of sharing art has become complex and inefficient.



**SOLUTIONS**

SparkLink will break through the centralized monopoly of content distribution by offering users a new, open source way of distributing and distributing NFT, through which anyone can become a creator and a sharer. In a decentralised world, creators are no longer restricted from creating content, everything is possible and anyone can interact with every user face to face. SparkLink makes it possible for every share to be a direct or indirect supporter of the creator, for every share to be a direct financial contribution to the creator, and for every share to be a part of the share to be a benefit to both the creator and the shareholder.&#x20;

SparkLink uses a hierarchical casting model from the NFT root node downwards, where content publishers own the root node of the NFT they publish, and users who purchase the work directly receive a corresponding number of cast sub-nodes, which can continue to be purchased and cast, forming new sub-nodes upon success. In the chain of child nodes that expand outwards from the root node, each node owner will receive a cut of the revenue from all the child nodes cast below their node, while the user who owns the root node will receive a fixed royalty and a cut of the node's revenue from the sale of each lower level node. From the creator to the sharer, everyone involved in the distribution of the work is linked together, and every click of the "share" button will create an interaction with all participants, which will become the common work of the creator and the sharer, eventually making it a huge model of creative sharing economy --Tree structure. SparkLink users are both users and owners of the platform, and all digital assets are stored on the user's wallet blockchain address. The misuse of personal information by centralized platforms will become a thing of the past in SparkLink, and the value of sharing will return to each participant.&#x20;

Share link: you are welcome to view and try casting my NFT: https://sparklink.io/#/NFT/Spark/425201762305/0x89

All of that will become reality just by clicking the "Share" button. ****&#x20;

**FEATURE**

Decentralisation: SparkLink's product logic is executed by the blockchain. When users upload information, generate works and store them, all information about the works and their ownership will be stored directly and permanently on the blockchain, and SparkLink has no right to modify or delete any work content of the platform users.&#x20;

DID: DID is Decentralized Identity. The W3C's DID specification is a widely accepted standard that ensures identity systems can interoperate across different networks and platforms. The DID architecture is outlined in the diagram below：

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png>)

A DID is an address on the Internet that one can own and control directly. It can be used to find associated DID documents, which contain information associated with the DID. a DID document contains relevant information to enable use cases such as login, data encryption, communication etc. Cryptographic proofs, such as digital signatures, allow entities to prove control over these identifiers.&#x20;

Users’ Rights: When a user purchases a NFT work posted by a creator on SparkLink, they will have the right to sell a certain number of copies of that work and the creator will receive a percentage of the proceeds from the sale and distribution of that work as well as a fixed amount of royalties.&#x20;

Payment to unlock:The NFT content work supports encryption and can be unlocked to check only after paid.

Secondary Creation: When a creator chooses to allow secondary creation of their work, the user will have the right to create a secondary version of that work after purchasing it, but the work can only be sold in the SparkLink ecosystem. Both the original author and the secondary creator will continue to receive a share of the sale proceeds.&#x20;

Community Governance: SparkLink encourages users to use any ERC-20, BEP-20, Polygon network standard pass-through token as a credential for settling revenue and paying fees for the work system. Users will form a decentralised governance organisation based on such tokens based on passwords.&#x20;

Tokenomics**：**Coming soon



**TECHNOLOGY**

NFT (Non-Fungible Token): SparkLink enables each user's interest to be tagged by an NFT pass through NFT technology, with ownership protected by the blockchain, where transfers, transactions and receipt of benefits are abstracted as methods to the NFT object, and neither other users nor the SparkLink platform can interfere with the user's own actions.&#x20;

Smart Contracts: SparkLink uses a decentralized approach to build applications, the logic is written in solidity language and is deployed as smart contracts on the Ethereum network (ETH), binance smart chain and Matic network , whose functionality cannot be tampered with or falsified, Fundamentally protect the rights of users.&#x20;

Decentralised storage: SparkLink uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) as its storage medium. Unlike traditional applications, SparkLink's distributed storage of users' work gives the platform no right to tamper with or delete users' content stored on IPFS, achieving complete decentralisation and security.&#x20;

#### IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC

SparkLink is a unique decentralised NFT content creation and sharing protocol, based on the web 3.0 concept，everyone can create their own NFT work on SparkLink and set a fee for the sale and distribution of their work. Any sale and distribution after the NFT has been generated will result in revenue for the work holder or node user. Unlike traditional NFTs, SparkLink published NFTs are not cast by the publisher all at once, but at the time of publication, each publisher will have a root NFT, and new NFT child nodes will be created when the work is purchased by the work's backer or sharer. The NFT from a child node can be re-cast to create the next level of child NFTs.&#x20;

Unique asymmetric encryption and distributed storage make it all possible,decentralization and use of a peer-to-peer network are important elements in order to allow creators to interact directly with their fans.\

#### LAST BUT NOT LEAST

Over the past decade, we have lived in a period where ownership was concentrated in the hands of a few centralised technology platforms that owned the data, end-user relationships and the way content was distributed and monetised. While user-generated content creation has exploded during this time, it has also led to dependence on a few new gatekeepers, widespread burnout and economic unsustainability for the vast majority of creators. Therefore, we have created a tree sharer economy on SparkLink decentralised platform that allows everyone to easily share their work through NFT, while generating a split tree economy to generate positive financial rewards for all creators and sharers, with all rights returned to users, where you can easily share your favourite content and earn economic profit. We believe that the technology based on web3 will bring incredible opportunities for everyone who contributes and creates on the internet, ultimately creating the true golden age of content and sharing that we have been waiting for.
